### Food Price Inflation Over Time
Lebanon has experienced **significant inflation in food prices**, especially post-2019. This period marks the **economic collapse**, triggered by mismanagement of public debt, currency depreciation, and political instability. **Food price inflation** reflects Lebanon's heavy reliance on imports and its inability to stabilize the local currency. 
- **Pre-2019**: Inflation remained relatively controlled, though rising slowly.
- **Post-2019**: Hyperinflation set in as the Lebanese pound depreciated significantly. By 2020, the situation worsened due to the **COVID-19 pandemic**, which exacerbated supply chain disruptions globally.

### General vs. Food CPI
Food prices have increased at a disproportionately higher rate compared to general consumer prices, particularly post-2019. This divergence underscores the critical role that food imports play in Lebanonâ€™s economy. **Currency devaluation**, **increased import costs**, and **supply chain disruptions** have disproportionately affected food prices, making inflation felt much more severely in basic goods compared to general services.
